# Algorithms Projects

h_bl_tree.cpp
  - Height-balanced tree, which updates number of leaves with every insertion
    and deletion. Includes a search by number function, which outputs the n-th
    leaf from left to right.Functions are tested with 40,000 leaves.

mergesort.cpp
  - Merge sort algorithm implemented on a linked list. Algorithm is tested
    with half a million random entries.

max_flow.cpp
  - Finds a maximum flow in a directed graph, using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    on capacities given as matrix

longestpath.c
  - Finds the longest x-monotone path in an arrangement of lines. The lines
    are given by their equations a[i]x+b[i]y = c[i] for i = 0, . . . , n âˆ’ 1.

++All above Algorithms are given a test.c file++


HeuristicSearch
  - The following Heuristic Search Algorithms are implemented on the maze
    provided: Hill climbing, Beam Search ( let beam width w = 2 ), Best First
    Search, Branch and Bound, Branch and Bound with Underestimates, Branch
    and Bound with Dynamic Programming, and Branch and Bound with both
    Underestimates and Dynamic Programming ( A* search )
