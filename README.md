CS PROJECTS
    Completed:
        - h_bl_tree.cpp
            Height-balanced tree, which updates number of leaves with every insertion and deletion.
            Includes a search by number function, which outputs the n-th leaf from left to right.
            Functions are tested with 40,000 leaves.

        - mergesort.cpp
            Merge sort algorithm implemented on a linked list. 
            Algorithm is tested with half a million random entries.
