# Algorithms

    h_bl_tree.cpp
            Height-balanced tree, which updates number of leaves with every insertion and deletion. Includes a search by number function, which outputs the n-th leaf from left to right.Functions are tested with 40,000 leaves.

    mergesort.cpp
            Merge sort algorithm implemented on a linked list. Algorithm is tested with half a million random entries.

    max_flow.cpp
            Finds a maximum flow in a directed graph, using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on capacities given as matrix
	
    longestpath.c
            Finds the longest x-monotone path in an arrangement of lines. The lines are given by their equations a[i]x+b[i]y = c[i] for i = 0, . . . , n âˆ’ 1.

*All above Algorithms are given a test.c file

	HeuristicSearch
            hill climbing, beam search ( let beam width w = 2 ), best first search, branch and bound, branch and bound with underestimates, branch and bound with dynamic programming, and branch and bound with both underestimates and dynamic programming ( A* search ) are implemented on the maze provided
